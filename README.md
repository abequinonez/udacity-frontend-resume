# Udacity Front-End Resume Project

This project was developed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The project guidelines called for a dynamically created resume page using JavaScript. The resume information is contained in four JavaScript objects, each of which also contains a display function to append the information to the page. With the help of the jQuery library, the code and information contained in resumeBuilder.js and helper.js is appended to index.html, resulting in the resume page that appears at runtime.
